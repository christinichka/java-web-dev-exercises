/* "If the product of two terms is zero then common sense says at least one of the two terms has to be zero
to start with. So if you move all the terms over to one side, you can put the quadratics into a form that
can be factored allowing that side of the equation to equal zero. Once you’ve done that, it’s pretty
straightforward from there." */


/* Possible Strategy:
a. Loop through the string one character at a time
b. Store and/or update the count for a given character using an appropriate data structure.
c. Loop through the data structure to print the results (one character and its count per line)
